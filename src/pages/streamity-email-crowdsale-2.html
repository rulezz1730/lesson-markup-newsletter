            <p class="annotation">Streamity is here to solve most of the crypto community problems. For example,
                the inherent difficulty of buying|selling crypto is addressed through a convenient UI and
                transactions verified by a smart contract. We are expanding a limited number of cryptocurrencies
                represented on exchanges by creating unique conditions for virtually all available crypto to be
                traded on Streamity. High fees and commissions give you grief? Streamity’s cut of your transactions
                is merely symbolic (0-2%).</p>
